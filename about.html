<p>Uh... Hello there! Welcome to &our shitposting site.</p>
<p>&We're a plural system consisting of many different worlds, headmates, and abilities!
    However, &we're
    rather private with our lives but once we get to you know you, we will share everything!
</p>
<p>Circe Aurora is the name of core planet where everyone started existing. It was chosen
    after a vote
    between the citizens in town and a large city, as well as the headmates who lived
    remotely in a
    house.</p>
<p>The town, named Circe, is a mix of cultures you can find on earth. Having a section for
    Modern
    European, Semi
    Traditional/Modern Japanese, and Suburban USA. All connected together with public
    transport, roads,
    and beautiful lanes that are safe for pedestrians and cyclists. It is a safe place with
    consideration for nature and a modern lifestyle while remaining beautiful and true to
    their
    architectural styles. Plenty of plants line the sides of streets, parks with beautiful
    big trees,
    and plenty of places to drink water from. It is designed for the simplicities of life
    and to enjoy
    it while being connected instead of distant from nature.</p>
<p>The large city, Aurora, is a futuristic city from USA, but taking tips from other
    countries such as
    the Netherlands. Its large streets allow for effective public transportation through
    various means
    (IE. Buses, trams, metro, express monorail) or allows for safe passage for cyclists and
    pedestrians.
    The streets are lined with angled parking, trees and other plant life, bins, drinking
    fountains,
    benches, and with access to bathrooms and covered benches to get away from the sun and
    elements. It
    runs on fusion power and superconductors, meaning it doesn't need to pollute to stay
    powered on.
    Despite the population and street design, traffic doesn't jam and flows rather well, the
    drivers
    patient and driving smoothly. The city's skyline is filled with various tall
    skyscrapers, most over
    100 floors high. These buildings are sometimes connected in the lower levels to acts as
    malls or
    other venues. But they also contain parking, residential, offices, and commercial
    rooms/sub-buildings to minimize travel needed. The buildings are also designed to combat
    against
    fires, floods, and other emergencies, allowing for easy and quick prevention of any
    minor disaster.
    The AIs and Robots help maintain the buildings alongside their humanoid counterparts, as
    robots and
    AI have full consciousness and rights.

<p>This is one of many worlds our system is connected to. We might add more to it later.</p>
